<ul>
  <li>Ensure you comply with the 3-2-1 rule</li>
  <li>Physical repositories are recommended where possible (ideally combined with proxy role using backup from storage snapshots).</li>
  <li>Calculate one repository core per three proxy cores</li>
  <li>Calculate 4GB RAM per repository CPU core</li>
  <li>The recommended minimum for a repository is two cores and 8GB RAM</li>
</ul>
<h1>Windows Server deduplication</h1>

<h2>Windows server deduplication</h2>
<p>Deduplication will take away some of the benefits of block storage repositories but provides efficient use of disk resources.</p>
<p>Follow the recommendations provided in the configuration guidelines above; here is the summary:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use the latest available Windows version (minimum requirement is Windows 2012 R2) and apply all patches (some roll-ups contain improvements to deduplication). Having most up to date system is critical for ensuring data safety.</li>
  <li>Format the disk using the command line <code>/L</code> option (for “large size file records”) and 64KB cluster size (use parameters <code>/Q /L /A:64K</code>)</li>
  <li>Follow <a href="https://bp.veeam.com/vbr/3_Build_structures/B_Veeam_Components/B_backup_repositories/deduplication.html">compression and deduplication guidelines</a> for non-integrated deduplication storage.</li>
  <li>(For Windows Server 2016 and later) the <a href="https://forums.veeam.com/veeam-backup-replication-f2/virtualized-backup-server-option-for-2016-dedup-t39049.html">Virtualized Backup Server</a> deduplication profile is to be preferred</li>
  <li>Modify garbage collection schedule to run daily rather than weekly.</li>
  <li>Use backup jobs configured to perform Active full with Incrementals.</li>
  <li>If possible, spread active full backups over the entire week.</li>
  <li>If Windows deduplication is used on REFS with Windows Server 2016 or newer, then Veeam Backup &amp; Replication turns off block cloning automatically for performance reasons. It is recommended to keep this default setting.</li>
  <li>Large files take a long time to deduplicate and will have to be fully reprocessed if the process is interrupted.</li>
  <li>Configure deduplication process to run once a day, and for as long as possible.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Use cases &amp; benefits of Veeam Replica vs Hyper-V Replica</h1>
<p>Pro-Hyper-V:<br>- lower RPO times (30 seconds)<br><br>Pro-Veeam<br>- file / application restores from replica snapshots<br>- more flexible scheduling options (30 seconds, 5 minutes, or 15 minutes are the only options in Hyper-V)<br>- easier failback (failover seems also easy in Hyper-V)<br>- performance of VM not permanently reduced due to background replication (only snapshot performance impact during snapshot replication)<br>- one UI / Reporting for backup and disaster recovery<br><br>So if you need to go to replications every 30 seconds, then Hyper-V replication is the way to go. For most other use cases, Veeam is the more comfortable / flexible way.</p>
